# Shared UI

Shared design system primitives for Clover Books Option B SPAs.

Usage:
- Import `@shared-ui/theme.css` and `@shared-ui/animations.css` once in each app.
- Use `AppShell` for layout backgrounds and `CloverSidebar` for navigation.
- Use `Card`, `Button`, `Input`, `Badge`, and `Loader` primitives for consistent styling.
