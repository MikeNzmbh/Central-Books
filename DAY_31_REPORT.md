## 🚀 Today's Major Breakthroughs (Dec 31)

### 1. Strategic Agent System Upgrades
Implemented 5 core improvements to the AI Employee ecosystem:
- **Robust AI Extraction**: Integrated LangChain and Pydantic for schema-enforced parsing of receipts and invoices.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Handback**: Developed a "Handback" mechanism in the `BaseAgent` allowing agents to flag low-confidence tasks for human review.
- **Multi-Agent Vector Memory**: Set up a shared FAISS-backed memory store allowing agents to recall previously stored context (e.g., user preferences).
- **Real-time Streaming Traces**: Configured Django Channels and WebSockets to stream agent "thought" traces to the UI (OperationsAgent monitoring).
- **Agentic Evaluation**: Created an `EvaluatorAgent` and a "Golden Dataset" to automatically measure and report system accuracy.

### 2. QBO Quality Bar Audit & Restoration
- **Glassy UI Restoration**: Restored the premium "Glassy" design system for the AI Companion and Dashboard.
- **QBO Quality Bar Fixes**: Applied 12 high-impact fixes across the platform to align with professional accounting standards (QuickBooks Online quality level).
- **Navigation Polish**: Speed up navigation transitions to eliminate "blinking" and improve the premium feel.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Infrastructure (Dec 27 - Dec 30)

### 1. Multi-App Separation
- Decoupled the repository into three distinct deployments:
  - **Customer Frontend**: React/Vite (Port 5173)
  - **Admin Frontend**: React/Vite (Port 5174)
  - **API Backend**: Django (JSON-only APIs)
- Configured secure cross-subdomain authentication and CORS policies.

### 2. Multi-Model LLM Router
- Implemented a flexible routing system supporting multiple providers:
  - **OpenAI (GPT-4o)** for complex extraction.
  - **DeepSeek** for high-reasoning companion features.
  - **Groq** for ultra-low latency Slack and chat responses.

### 3. PostgreSQL & RLS Integration
- Migrated persistence from SQLite to **PostgreSQL**.
- Implemented **Row Level Security (RLS)** using `withTenantTxn` helpers, ensuring 100% tenant isolation at the database level.

## ✨ UI/UX & Experimental Features (Dec 24 - Dec 29)

### 1. TARS 3D Login Experience
- Built a custom 3D Login page using raw **Three.js**.

### 2. AI Companion System Map
- Refactored the Companion UI to use a "Control Tower" approach.
- Implemented modular panels: `SuggestionsPanel`, `IssuesPanel`, and `CloseAssistantDrawer`.
- **Customer-Safe Copy**: Removed internal jargon across all AI-generated surfaces to make the product user-friendly.
