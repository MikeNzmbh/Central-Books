## The Problem

Small business bookkeeping is broken:

- **60% of SMB owners** spend 5+ hours per week on manual bookkeeping
- **40% of small businesses** fail due to cash flow mismanagement
- **$2,000+/month** for fractional CFO services most can't afford
- **Tax season panic**: Errors discovered when it's too late to fix

Existing solutions fall short:

| Solution | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| **Spreadsheets** | Error-prone, no audit trail, compliance nightmare |
| **QuickBooks/Xero** | Complex UI, assumes accounting knowledge |
| **Cheap alternatives** | Feature-poor, no insights |
| **ChatGPT wrappers** | Can answer questions, can't *do* the work |
